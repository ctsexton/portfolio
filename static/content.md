about:
  description: Hi, I'm Cam! A software developer and musician, focused on building functional, efficient software.
  location: Los Angeles, CA
  focuses:
    - Front End Development with React & Vue
    - Data Analysis with Python
  whatIBring:
    - A holistic understanding of <i>systems</i> - I make it my business to know small the details and how they fit into the structural architecture of the problem domain.
    - A preference for simple, easy to understand solutions explained with no technical jargon.
    - Working code. Readable & documented.
    - Humility, mentorship & paying it forward - I love both learning from others and sharing what I have learned. I also worked for several years as a (music) teacher and have a healthy skepticism for expensive code bootcamps. Everything we need to know is available freely on the web and if I can save you several hours/weeks by pointing you in the right direction then we can achieve far more, faster!
